# ZS-Hiring-Challenge

My solution to the ZS Data Science Challenge 2019: **Business License Status Prediction.**

Our goal is to perform a **multi-class classification** of the business license status of various users, from the given
dataset. Since it is a very imbalanced dataset, we will have to use the statistical techniques like **oversampling and
undersampling** of data.

**Data Pipeline:** Data Inspection -> Data Visualizations -> Data Cleaning -> Sampling Data -> Data Modeling -> Model
Evaluation

**Languages Used:** Python
